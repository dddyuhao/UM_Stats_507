# UM_Stats_507
This repository contains my coursework for **STATS 507** at the University of M.

## Course overview
STATS 507 surveys commonly used tools and workflows in data science. The course begins with an accelerated introduction to Python programming, then focuses on the scientific Python stack (**NumPy**, **SciPy**, **pandas**, **scikit-learn**), along with tools such as **git** and debugging practices. The final part of the course introduces deep learning using **PyTorch**.

## Purpose of this repository
The purpose of this repository is to:
- store homework/problem set submissions and supporting code,
- keep lecture notes, experiments, and practice notebooks organized,
- provide a clean workflow for STATS 507 assignments and the final project.
